# Production Monitoring Device

This project deals with the monitoring of products produced in an Industry. I have prepared this system for an Weapon manufacturing industry. 

The system basically measures the weight of the products produced by the employees further determining the count of the products produced. The data is continuosly sent to the central server wirelessly via the `WiFi` connection to the Intranet setup of the industry.
